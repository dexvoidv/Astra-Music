## 🚀 **Project Status**

**Astra Music** is in **semi-active development**, evolving steadily but at a measured pace.  
It is a **personal and closed-source** project, developed entirely using **Sketchware Pro** and **Android IDE**.

---

## 🔒 **About the Code Status**

**Astra Music is not a traditional open-source project.**

Development is primarily done with **Sketchware Pro**, a tool that uses its own proprietary project format (`.swb`) instead of a standard, easily versionable code structure (like Android Studio).

Due to this technical limitation:

- Conventional **pull requests** cannot be accepted  
- Simultaneous collaboration among multiple developers is not feasible  
- Version control and **merges** cannot be managed securely  

For this reason, the project remains **closed and individually developed**.

> 💡 **Note:** Suggestions, ideas, and bug reports are welcome via  
> 👉 [**Issues on GitHub**](https://github.com/dexvoidv/Astra-Music/issues)  
>  
> In the future, a potential **migration to plain code** is being considered when technical conditions allow it.
